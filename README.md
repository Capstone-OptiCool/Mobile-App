## About
### ðŸ”¥ Wrap Up
We are a Mobile Development team, who created "OptiCool", an application built on Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, leveraging Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture. This application helps users determine suitable glasses based on face shape. The application provides suggestions for suitable places to purchase glasses by providing a purchase link from a website. The standout feature of OptiCool is its machine learning function that identifies human facial features with 90% accuracy. This innovative feature, supported by a cloud deployment model from our Cloud Computing team, simplifies the user experience.
